I am writing to express my interest in the Research Assistant position at the UBC Computational Climate Lab, as advertised through the Work Learn Program. 
I am currently an undergraduate student at UBC pursuing a Bachelors of Applied Science in Computer Engineering. 

I have a strong foundation in quantitative problem-solving, having completed Calculus I-III, Linear Algebra, and Differential Equations. 
I am particularly intereseted in applying numerical analysis techniques to deepen my understanding of mathematical modeling through this position. 
It would be exciting to work under a supervisor with a Master’s degree in Applied Mathematics who will provide invaluable mentorship to further develop these skills.

My prior experience working on full-stack applications and managing data workflows has equipped me with strong skills in data management, 
version control (including GitHub), and scientific computing. I am a motivated, independent learner and am confident in my ability to work 
effectively both independently and collaboratively within a research team. Additionally, I have some experience with bash and command-line environments, 
which I understand will be valuable when working with the HPC cluster.

I am enthusiastic about the chance to develop my skills in numerical modeling, climate science, and data analysis while contributing meaningfully to 
ongoing research projects at the Computational Climate Lab. I am eager to engage in the lab’s supportive community, participate in regular meetings, 
and further my understanding of the physical Earth system and scientific research practices.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume and class schedule for your review. I look forward to the possibility of 
discussing how my background and skills can contribute to your research team.
